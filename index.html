                                        <p><ul>
                                        <li> Worked across teams to develop a new set of APIs by having discussions to collect requirements from external teams, designing models for the APIs, and getting them approved by multiple stakeholders.</li>
                                        <li> Investigated design tradeoffs for these APIs by analyzing different compute options such as Lambda and ECS by looking at factors such as cost, auto-scaling, instance management, and invocation impact on latency, investigating multiple storage options for our audit information including S3, CloudWatch, and OpenSearch, investigating whether batch processing for the APIs would be an issue based on forecasted payload sizes, and designing how authorization, auditing, idempotency, etc. would work.</li>
                                        <li> Led the development of these major new features by creating an implementation plan and tasks in each sprint. Wrote code in Java using AWS CDK, Swagger, and OpenAPI and deployed them using a CI/CD pipeline. Documented guide on how to use APIs and received positive feedback from clients. </li>
                                        <li> Designed and helped implement a new user interface for Amazon’s fulfillment orchestration system using CloudFront, S3, Java, TypeScript, and React. Project reduced on-call load by around 30%, enabling the team to take on more clients and scale faster. </li>
                                        <li> Analyzed ways to reduce our latency spikes in certain APIs and considered various ambiguous potential solutions such as caching, request timeout settings, setting the APIs to be eventually consistent, etc. and implemented solution that successfully eliminated the spikes. </li>
                                        <li> Re-designed metrics and alarms to reduce the number of false tickets from 2-3 a week to nearly 0. Ran load tests and analyzed results to understand our max TPS and ensure we were sufficiently scaled to handle peak traffic that occurred during the holidays. </li>
                                        <li> Reviewed code developed by other developers and provided feedback to ensure best practices. Addressed gaps in others code reviews related to functionality, testing, efficiency, extensible code, and clear variable and file naming conventions. </li>
                                        <li> Helped fix high severity issues during on-call by first performing actions to immediately unblock clients and then creating and implementing long-term fixes to prevent the same issues from happening again. </li>
                                        </ul></p>

            <div> The ASL Robotic Hand is a two-way communication system between English and American Sign Language (ASL). 
              <p> </p>
              <p>A robotic hand performs the ASL alphabet by taking in input text
                 from a computer. The robot hand uses torsion springs that allows
                 the fingers of the hand to be straight. The strings are connected to the base of the string 
                 using strings connected to servo motors. These motors pull the strings and thus the fingers 
                 of the hands down and to the left and the right, allowing for movement of the hand.
                 <p></p>
                 <p>
                 A Leap Motion sensor takes in hand position and movement
                 to translate ASL to English. We then transformed the data to calculate consecutive fingertip distances, finger bend angle, and knuckle slope.
                 We used Linear Discriminant Analysis to recognize the sign the user was creating.</p>

            <div>TL;DR is a Chrome extension that compiles and summarizes the most notable sections of End User License Agreements (EULAs).
              <p> </p>
            <p>It finds the most notable sections of such a legal document — namely, sections which seem unusual and do not align with typical EULAs — and compiles them into a brief summary. Since it is a Chrome Extension, users can use it directly from their browser when they encounter one of these legal documents. A user would highlight the text they wish to be summarized and would subsequently see a brief summary that lists the most noteworthy parts of the document. </p>

            <div>
            <p>
            Chord Buddy is an application to help beginner guitar players learn and memorize chords on the guitar. It cycles through chords that the user must play within a few seconds and then tells them if the shape and sound of the chord they played is correct using neural networks to recognize the chord's sound and shape on the fingerboard.  
            </p>
            <p>
              A picture and sound recording is taken of the user playing the chord. The picture is run through a VGG neural network model with four convolutional layers and two dense layers. We added a flatten and dropout layer to prevent overfitting since we have limited data and we used SoftMax activation and categorical cross entropy loss.  We trained the model on our data using an augmentation configuration to prevent overfitting.

This allows the user to feel like they are really sitting in a boat and riding on the waves. </p>

        <p>In my free time, I like to do silly projects with friends. We’ve programmed our Anki Vector robot to be sassy, built an unnecessarily complicated Secret Santa gift exchange, and built a program to settle once and for all whether or not there is a Set left among the twelve cards we’ve laid out when playing the card game Set. </p>
        <p class="mb-0">I also love to draw and 
          find it really calming to get lost in and 
          focus on a drawing for a few hours. </p>
